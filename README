Spring 3.2 REST Web Application Starter
==========================================

Spring REST Starter is an skeleton to create new Rest Server Applications 
using the latest techniques and versions of the most widely used Web Frameworks.

The idea behind of this project is  the simplification of the Server Environments, using
technologies and architectures that transfer the complexity of the procedures to the
client. This projects encourages the use of state-less servers transferring the MVC pattern,
and in particular the controller logic, to the client's browser via JavaScript.

This REST Web Application Starter has been design with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) in mind, 
since this JavaScript Framework provides a very elegant and powerful way to transfer the logic
to the client.

The following aspects can be highlighted:

REST with HATEOAS
-------------------------------------------

Spring REST Starter uses the [Spring Data REST](http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/rest)
library that provides a very simple way to generate Rest interfaces that follow 
the [HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) principle.

Security and Authentication
-------------------------------------------

This project also uses the [Spring Security](http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/index.html) 
Framework, that provides an ideal way to handle Authentication and Authorization.
The Authentication model selected 
has been [Digest Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication), since it 
does not send the password to the server and is more powerful than Basic Authentication.

HMAC Authentication is also an option, but since there is no default implementation, it has not been
implemented.

In order to use this project in a production environment as is, HTTPS should be used to encrypt the network.

Configuration
-------------------------------------------

Spring REST Starter uses the latest versions of the libraries in order to be able to have an XML free environment.

Everything, from the basic Spring Beans to the Web Initialization and the Spring Security configuration has
been implemented with JavaConfig.

Database
-------------------------------------------

For this Starter, the HSQLDB database has been selected, but it would be very easy to change the
datasource.properties file in order to have a different database.

We encourage to use the Profile concept to have different databases.

Tests
-------------------------------------------

To be Completed.
